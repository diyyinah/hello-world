Working through a GitHub intro tutorial! :)

"Write a bit about yourself"
Hello! My name is Diyyinah and this is my first time on GitHub. :) I've heard about GitHub before at my work at ASAP Media Services, and again hanging out at the Makerspace, and then again at #GCcomms2017! It was the table talk I had about open source coding and GitHub that made me decide to create an account now. I've done HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding (though I'm self-taught from playing around and googling, and am by no means an expert!!). I joined the Python club on campus and am currently taking Ruby on Rails courses on campus as well. Looking forward to starting this journey of programming!
